This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Basic description of the project

This project utilizes the power of ReactJS frontend using the NodeJS server. Along with frontend UI, we power the data in the web app using the APIs- Application Programming Interfaces. 

## Home 

This is a simple rendered page, using a Navbar and Footer. It gives the clear meaning of our group name- "Bhaukaal", which is a slang from the much hyped web series Mirzapur. The home page just tells more about this hype and gives insights into the season 2 of the same web series.


## Cricket

This page uses cricapi to render realtime IPL scores, and results of previous matches alongside the schedule of new matches. All data is server rendered, during the runtime.

## Food

This page uses API from Zomato website, and also uses the current user's IP address to tell about nearby restaurants and gives some info on that. The IP detection part is a novel approach, so the user sees the restuarants nearby and accessible to him/her.

## News

This page uses the News API to render latest news articles, based on various topics such as Sports, Technology and health.
